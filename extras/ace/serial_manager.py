        for one connection's lifetime, identified by `generation`.

        Operates ONLY on the `serial_obj` it was started with - never on
        self._serial - so connect()/disconnect() can freely replace
        self._serial for a new connection without any coordination with
        this thread. Once this thread notices (via `generation`) that it's
        been superseded, it closes its OWN serial_obj itself and exits: no
        join, no shared stop-event, so disconnect() never blocks the
        reactor waiting for this thread, and no two threads ever touch the
        same serial object (each owns exactly one for its whole life).

        CONFIRMED (field-tested): repeatedly calling write() on a device
        that has already been physically disconnected - one failure after
        another, each one a fresh usb_submit_urb() the kernel driver has
        to reject - is what actually wedges this Pi's USB controller. A
        single failed write is not enough; a `while true` loop retrying a
        write once a second against an already-unplugged port reliably
        killed it within ~5 seconds (`acm_start_wb - usb_submit_urb(write
        bulk) failed: -19` once per attempt, then xHCI death). A read-only
        `cat` held open across the same unplug/replug did NOT kill it.
        So: the very first write failure (timeout or otherwise) must stop
        this generation from ever calling write() again - reconnection
        happens by spinning up a brand new generation/object, never by
        continuing to retry on this one.
